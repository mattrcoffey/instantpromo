    <td>Dear {name},<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for taking the time to complete our Price and Mock-Up Request form. Your enquiry is now with both our Sales and Design teams and they will work together over the next few hours (possibly up to 24hrs) to produce a mock-up and a fully itemised quotation with a variety of options to choose from.<br>
      <br>
      Your Reference Number is: <strong>{reference}</strong> <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Artwork Requirements</strong><br>
      <br>
      For the purposes of the mock-up lower resolution artwork will be fine for us to use at this stage, however if your lead time is short (7-10 days) we recommend that you source and send your highest resolution artwork (preferably in AI or EPS format) to <a href="mailto:sales@instantpromotionusa.com">sales@instantpromotionusa.com</a> as soon as possible. We will add these artwork files to your case file which will in turn dramatically speed up the artwork sign off process at the point you wish to confirm an order.<br>
      <br>
      <strong> Lead Time</strong><br>
      <br>
      Our lead times typically vary from 5-10 working days (from artwork sign-off), however if your deadline is between 5-7 working days please call our sales team quoting your enquiry reference number on <strong>1-888-250-4307</strong> and we will be happy to discuss Priority Production options to ensure you don't miss your event.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Contacting Us</strong><br>
      <br>
      Please rest assured that your enquiry has been received and is currently being dealt with by our team, however if you would like to contact us now to discuss any aspect of your enquiry call <strong>1-888-250-4307</strong> or email <a href="mailto:sales@instantpromotionusa.com">sales@instantpromotionusa.com</a>.</td>
